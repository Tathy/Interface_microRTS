# Interface MicroRTS
In this project, we introduce an interface to simplify the development of scripts for MicroRTS.

This interface uses a DSL focused on MicroRTS actions, called MicroLanguage. Please watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeuzrjKaqsU) on how to use our tool for writing scripts for MicroRTS. 

This work is part of a research project from the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, which aims to study the advantages of this kind of approach in building programs for playing MicroRTS and the impacts of such an approach on programmers’ productivity.

To start using the program, please see our https://github.com/Tathy/Interface_microRTS/wiki.
