# Interface MicroRTS
In this proejct, we introduce an interface to simplify the development of scripts for MicroRTS.

This interface uses a DSL focused on MicroRTS actions, called MicroLanguage. Please watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeuzrjKaqsU) on how to use our tool for writing scripts for MicroRTS. 

This work is part of a research project from the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, which aims to study the advantages of this kind of approach in building programs for playing MicroRTS and the impacts of such an approach on programmers’ productivity.

Steps to execute the project:
*  Download (or clone) the repository.

* (Windows and Mac) Double-click the jar's file called MicroRTSinterface.jar.

* (Linux) Open terminal in the source folder, and type "java -jar MicroRTSinterface.jar"

The project needs [JSE or JDK 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) to perform correctly.
